This uses the same DC crime dataset that I introduced to you last week.

For your homework, 

1) construct similar effect estimates for CFS2 (infrastructure calls for service) for values of 1 to 10 using a negative binomial model
2) do this for a model including the splines of the area term and without. Be able to write down the model. 
3) create a table of the two models coefficients, 
4) and then create a graph showing the different effect estimates for the model without splines versus the model with splines
