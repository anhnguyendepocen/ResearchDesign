# ResearchDesign
 
Seminar in Criminology Research and Analysis Class (for PhD students in Criminology). CRIM 7301 at UTD specifically when I delivered it in person. 

See the ClassOverview folder for example syllabus and material related to the final project. Then you have weekly lectures, along with a coding assignment. Code examples are in R, Stata, SPSS, and social network analysis stuff in Python.

If you cannot get access to the reading materials, just email me and I will forward them. If a teacher, you can email me for example finished homeworks.

# ToDo

 - Add in HTML pages with math for non-linear regression/generalized linear models lecture
     - [Splines](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~Andrew.Wheeler/Splines.html)
     - [Poisson regression](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~Andrew.Wheeler/PoissonReg.html)
 - Incorporate Synthetic Control into DiD lecture
     - see [this blog post]( https://andrewpwheeler.wordpress.com/2019/12/06/using-regularization-to-generate-synthetic-controls-and-conformal-prediction-for-significance-tests/) for an R code example (using `synth` with placebo, and comparing to lasso). 
	 - Stata synth example???
 - Intro to installing Stata commands in computer lab
 - Python machine learning examples (and calling python machine learning from ?Stata?)
 
If you have suggestions, always feel free to email!
