This is data taken from my dissertation. See https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3385251/AndyW_Dissertation.pdf

This contains three code snippets - one for R, one for SPSS, and one for Stata, illustrating how one can make a reproducible analysis. It also shows some general descriptive statistics and graphs.

Each has portions you may need to edit. For example, each specifies a local path, so it knows where the "DC_Crime_MicroPlaces.csv" resides. It also specifies code in R to download a package, which may need to be downloaded to a writable drive.

If you have questions, just ask.
